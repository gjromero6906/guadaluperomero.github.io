This project provided me an opportunity to build something with AI assistance. Check out my [AI Usage Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EoFq7uXqfECldPPkM7m6wbS9KSgJDy8xsQKWupmTitY/edit?tab=t.0) to see how I used AI on this project.

One technical concept I developed greater mastery over in this project was CSS layout using Flexbox and Grid. At the beginning of the project, I thought of layout mostly as trial and error—adding properties until things “looked right.” As I worked through building my site, my understanding shifted toward seeing layout as a system of parent and child relationships, where containers control how their elements behave.

My mental model now is that Flexbox is best used when I want to align or distribute items in one direction, while Grid allows me to think more structurally about the page as a whole. This shift helped me approach layout decisions more intentionally. I applied this understanding throughout my project by using Flexbox to align navigation elements and section content, and Grid to structure my projects section in a way that responds smoothly to different screen sizes.

Challenging Project Requirement I’m Proud Of

One project requirement I found both challenging and rewarding was creating a responsive projects section. This part of the project pushed me to slow down and really examine my code instead of immediately assuming the issue was with CSS alone. When the grid wasn’t behaving as expected, I realized the problem was rooted in my HTML structure, not just my styling.

To address this, I reorganized my markup so that each project card was a direct child of the grid container. From there, I defined a single-column layout for smaller screens and used media queries to progressively increase the number of columns as the screen size grew. Working through this challenge taught me the importance of separating structure from styling and reinforced the idea that clean, intentional HTML makes CSS much easier to reason about and debug.

How I Leveraged AI During Development

I leveraged AI as a thinking partner rather than a solution generator during this project. When I encountered bugs or confusing behavior, I used AI to help me articulate what I was seeing and to guide me toward understanding why something wasn’t working. The explanations helped me connect concepts like layout context, selector targeting, and responsive design to what I was building in real time.

Using AI in this way encouraged me to ask better questions and reflect more deeply on my own problem-solving process. Instead of rushing to a fix, I learned to pause, analyze, and make more informed decisions, which ultimately made me more confident in my ability to debug and build independently.
